# Code-Quiz
**The Project Itself**
Build a quiz, when a user chooses the correct answer another question is displayed, when a user chooses an incorrect answer, one second is removed from the timer.  When the gamne is finished, a text box appears for the user to enter in initials to go with score.  The score an initials will be kept in locl storage, and can be viewed at any point during the game.   
**The Process**
This was a very challenging projct to take on, I almost wish I had a few more days to work on it.  Within the time contraints I was able to get the quiz functioning and tallying score, and I was able to get the timer to work on start and subtract time as the user selected incorrect answers.  I will continue to work on this project to add the additional features. I learned a lot about coding in this project, and maybe lost a few hairs!
