//GOAL: I am taking a quiz that will regenerate after each question in answered, and will reduce the timer by one second each time the user incorrectly answers a question.


//TODO: create a click to start button that will start the timer, and take the user to the next screen.


//TODO: Figure out how to refresh the page to a new page each time the user clicks a response.


//TODO: Figure out the mathmatics of when user clicks this then this etc. 


//TODO: When a timer starts, presented with a question


//TODO: answer a question presented with another question


//TODO: answer a question incorrectly time is subtracted from the clock


//TO DO: all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over, then the user enters initials to save score and can see the tally.
